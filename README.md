## Installation

No installation required. Just visit the [website](https://bill.tmlwu.net) to use the tool.

## Run Locally

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Type Support for .vue Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

### Project setup

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

- Compile and Hot-Reload for **Development**

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

- Type-Check, Compile and Minify for **Production**

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
